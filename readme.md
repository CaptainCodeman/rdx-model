# Rdx-Model

A wrapper for [rdx](https://github.com/CaptainCodeman/js-rdx), my tiny
Redux alternative, which makes bundling a state model small and simple.

Based on the approach of [redux-rematch](https://rematch.github.io/rematch/)
to reduce the boilerplate required when using a redux-like state store.

for more backgground.
